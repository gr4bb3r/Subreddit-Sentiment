# Subreddit-Sentiment
Scrape thousands of reddit posts for a weighted sentiment score from a dict of keywords (like stocks)

->Personal information such as api keys and directory names have been scrubbed from this tool. You will need to update those with your own in order for the tool to work.
->Store all the files in the same directory and run head_script
->If everything is set up properly, you will get a nice table with weighted sentiments for your keywords!
->Enjoy!
